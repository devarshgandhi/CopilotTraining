## 🏗️ Training Philosophy

### The Shift: Syntax Wizards → Markdown Whisperers

| Old Metrics | New Metrics |
|------------|-------------|
| Syntax memorization | Clear articulation of intent |
| Clever code only you understand | Code anyone can maintain |
| Fast typing | Fast thinking and design |
| Being the "only expert" | Scaling knowledge across the team |

In the age of AI assistance, the bottleneck isn't "can you write the code?" — it's "do you know what to build?"

### Four Principles

| Principle | Core Message |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Clarity Beats Cleverness** | Understandable code trumps clever code |
| 🎯 **Intent Over Implementation** | Describe WHAT, not HOW |
| 📚 **Documentation Is Leverage** | Write once, benefit infinitely |
| ⚖️ **Human Judgment Is Non-Negotiable** | AI proposes, you decide |

## 🔧 Content Development

New tech talks are generated through an automated 4-phase workflow:

1. **Research** — Copilot CLI gathers source material and examples from URLs
2. **Plan** — Content outline committed for review
3. **Build** — README.md generated from approved plan (`/approve-plan`)
4. **Slides** — Slidev deck generated from README

See [workflow documentation](.github/workflows/README.md) for details.
