**What you'll find**:
- 10-12 hour self-paced workshop building a production application
- Persona-driven narratives following six team members
- Progressive modules covering repository instructions, agent plan mode, custom prompts, custom agents, MCP servers, and more
- Quantifiable before/after metrics showing real improvement
- Complete working codebase ([FanHub](https://github.com/MSBart2/FanHub) template)

**Start here**: [Workshop README](workshop/README.md)

**Key modules**:
- Repository instructions and architecture documentation
- Agent plan mode for structured AI collaboration
- Custom prompts and reusable workflows
- Custom agents for autonomous task completion
- MCP servers for external system integration
- Enterprise patterns for organizational scale

### 🔧 [Technical Deep-Dives](tech-talks/)

**Audience**: Practitioners exploring specific capabilities or patterns

**Format**: Technical presentations (30-60 minutes)

**What you'll find**:
- Clear problem statements and motivation
- Technical depth with practical examples
- Architectural diagrams and system flows
- Implementation guidance and tradeoffs
- Concrete takeaways for immediate application

**Topics include**:
- **[Agentic PRs](tech-talks/agentic-prs/)** — PR workflows for feature-scale AI-generated changes

## 🏗️ Training Philosophy

All content in this repository shares core principles:

### The Shift: Syntax Wizards → Markdown Whisperers

**Old metrics**:
- Syntax memorization
- Clever code only you understand
- Fast typing
- Being the "only expert"

**New metrics**:
- Clear articulation of intent
- Code anyone can maintain
- Fast thinking and design
- Scaling knowledge across the team

**Why it matters**: In the age of AI assistance, the bottleneck isn't "can you write the code?"—it's "do you know what to build?" Clarity of thought beats knowledge of syntax.

### The Four Principles

Every module connects back to these core ideas:

| Principle | Core Message |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Clarity Beats Cleverness** | Understandable code trumps clever code |
| 🎯 **Intent Over Implementation** | Describe WHAT, not HOW |
| 📚 **Documentation Is Leverage** | Write once, benefit infinitely |
| ⚖️ **Human Judgment Is Non-Negotiable** | AI proposes, you decide |
