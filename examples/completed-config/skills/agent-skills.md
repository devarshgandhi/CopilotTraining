# FanHub Agent Skills Library

> Agent Skills teach GitHub Copilot domain-specific knowledge. This library contains skills for TV show data validation, product requirements, and FanHub development workflows.

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are specialized folders containing:
- `SKILL.md` file with instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Optional scripts, examples, and resources
- Domain-specific knowledge Copilot loads when relevant

Skills are part of an [open standard](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) used by various AI coding assistants.

### Where Skills Live

| Location | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.github/skills/` | Project | Shared with everyone on the project |
| `~/.copilot/skills/` | Personal | Available in all your projects |

### Skills vs Instructions vs Prompts

| Feature | Instructions | Prompts | Skills |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| **Loaded** | Always | Manually invoked | Automatically when relevant |
| **Scope** | Broad standards | Specific templates | Specialized tasks |
| **Contains** | Guidelines | Structured queries | Instructions + scripts + examples |
| **Best for** | Team conventions | Repeatable workflows | Domain expertise |

## FanHub Skills Library

This library contains three production-ready skills for FanHub development. Each skill is stored in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io).

### 1. TV Show Data Validator

**Location**: `tv-show-data-validator/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: Validates TV show data (characters, episodes, shows) against FanHub schema requirements.

**Key Features**:
- Character validation (required fields, status enums, foreign keys)
- Episode validation (season/episode uniqueness, proper numbering)
- Show validation (status values, premiere years)
- Common error detection patterns

**Use this when**: Creating database seed data, writing API handlers, generating test fixtures, or validating request/response bodies.

### 2. Feature Requirements

**Location**: `feature-requirements/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: Product requirements for FanHub features. Ensures features meet product standards for error handling, UX, analytics, accessibility, and responsive design.

**Key Features**:
- Error handling patterns (boundaries, async errors, user-friendly messages)
- User feedback requirements (loading states, notifications, confirmations)
- Analytics tracking conventions
- Accessibility standards (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Responsive design guidelines

**Use this when**: Creating new pages/routes, building React components, implementing user interactions, or adding forms.

### 3. API Endpoint Design

**Location**: `api-endpoint-design/SKILL.md`

**Purpose**: REST API design standards for FanHub's Express backend.

**Key Features**:
- URL conventions (lowercase, plural nouns, nested routes, versioning)
- HTTP method guidelines
- Response format standards (success/error structures)
- Status code usage
- Complete endpoint template

**Use this when**: Creating or modifying API endpoints to ensure consistency across the backend.
