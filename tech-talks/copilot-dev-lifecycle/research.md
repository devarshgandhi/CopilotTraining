### Agentics Repository
- https://github.com/githubnext/agentics — Reusable agentic workflow collection (30+ workflows)

### Key Concepts
- **Continuous AI**: Integration of AI into the SDLC, augmenting CI/CD with AI-driven automation
- **Safe Outputs**: Permission-isolated write operations (PRs, issues, comments) with guardrails
- **Peli's Agent Factory**: 100+ specialized agentic workflows explored in practice
- **Defense-in-depth**: 3-layer security (substrate, configuration, plan-level trust)

## Key Findings

### Pre-Coding
- CCA Plan Mode for structured planning sessions
- Issue-based workflows with `/plan` command for breaking down tasks
- MCP servers for domain-specific context during planning
- Session logs that persist across coding sequences
- Repo understanding via `@workspace` and codebase analysis

### Coding Workflows
- Context-aware code generation with custom instructions
- Chat-driven development with iterative refinement
- CCA as primary agentic builder (multi-step tasks)
- Automated refactoring and test generation
- PR and no-PR workflows for flexibility
- MCP integrations for specialized tools

### Post-Coding
- PR Summaries auto-generated by CCA
- Copilot Code Review for automated review
- Repo instructions (copilot-instructions.md) for compliance
- DevOps integration through GitHub Actions

### Agentic Workflows (gh-aw)
- Markdown-defined workflows running in GitHub Actions
- Read-only by default, write via safe outputs
- Categories: triage, documentation, code quality, testing, security, reporting
- Patterns: ChatOps, DailyOps, DataOps, IssueOps, ProjectOps, MultiRepoOps, Orchestration
- Supports Copilot CLI, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex as engines

### New in 2026
- Copilot SDK preview for custom integrations
- PR-decoupled workflows (plan without PR)
- Agent MD instructions for agent behavior
- MCP-native workload support
