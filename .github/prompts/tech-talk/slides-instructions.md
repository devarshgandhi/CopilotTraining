# Slide Generation Instructions for Tech Talk

You are generating Slidev presentation slides from a tech talk README.

## Details

- **Issue Number:** {{ISSUE_NUMBER}}
- **Topic:** {{TOPIC}}
- **Primary Question:** {{PRIMARY_QUESTION}}
- **Target Audience:** {{AUDIENCE}}
- **Duration:** {{DURATION}}

## Source Content

Read these files from the branch:
- `tech-talks/{{TOPIC}}/README.md` — Primary source for slides
- `tech-talks/{{TOPIC}}/images/` — Visual assets to reference

## Your Task

Generate `slides/tech-talks/{{TOPIC}}.md` following the Slidev slide generation guidelines.

### Slide Requirements

- **Maximum 15-20 slides** — force focused, essential content only
- **Extract from README** — preserve quotes, metrics, and exercise objectives
- **Visual hierarchy** — use emoji vocabulary consistently (🎯, ⏰, 📊, etc.)
- **Dark cockpit-style design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Never use Mermaid diagrams**
- Map slides from the `<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION -->` markers in the README
- Reference images using paths relative to the slides directory

### Slide Sequence

1. Title/Logo Slide ← from H1 title + subtitle
2. Question/Objective Slide ← "The Question" section
3. Table of Contents ← from 🎬 major sections
4. Problem Slide ← "The Problem" section
5. Solution Overview ← "The Solution" section
6. Key Artifacts ← artifact inventory
7. **🧠 The Shift (Preview)** ← Core Insight one-liner ONLY. Simple "From X → To Y" visual. No bullets. Plants the thesis before the evidence.
8. Decision Tree ← When to use / not use
9-14. Major Section slides (2-4 per section)
15. Use Cases ← real-world examples
16. **🧠 Mental Model Shift (Full)** ← Complete Move Toward ✅ / Away ⚠️ / Against 🛑 grid. This is the reinforcement after the audience has seen the evidence.
17. Actionable Outcomes ← checklist
18. Related Patterns
19. **📖 References** ← Numbered reference list (REQUIRED)
20. End Slide

### Mental Model: Shown Twice

The mental model **must appear twice**:
- **Slide 7 "The Shift"**: Only the Core Insight one-liner from `> **The Core Insight:**` in the README. Clean, visual, minimal. Use a large "From → To" layout. No detail bullets.
- **Slide 16 "Mental Model Shift"**: The full Move Toward / Away / Against content. Two-column grid layout with ✅ and 🛑 items. This lands with authority because the audience now has context.

### References in Slides

The README contains inline `[^n]` citations and a `## 📖 References` section. Handle them as follows:

- **On content slides**: Where the README cites a source, add a small footnote at the bottom of the slide:
  ```html
  <div class="absolute bottom-4 left-8 text-xs opacity-40">[3] docs.github.com/copilot/...</div>
  ```
  Show only 1-2 footnotes per slide max. Use shortened URLs (domain + path prefix).

- **References slide (#19)**: Dedicated slide showing all references in a compact grid:
  ```markdown
  # 📖 References
  <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 text-xs mt-4">
  <div>[1] <strong>Title</strong> — domain.com/path</div>
  <div>[2] <strong>Title</strong> — domain.com/path</div>
  ...
  </div>
  ```
  Group by type (Official Docs, Blog Posts, Community). Keep it readable — abbreviate URLs.

### Formatting Rules

- Each slide starts with `---` separator
- Use frontmatter for layout: `layout: default`, `layout: center`, `layout: end`
- Keep bullet points to 4-6 per slide max
- Code blocks should be small (8-12 lines max per slide)
- Use `v-click` for progressive reveal sparingly

## Output

Create: `slides/tech-talks/{{TOPIC}}.md`

If the file already exists, overwrite it with the new version.
