# Copilot Instructions for CopilotWorkshop Content Development

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three types of content, each with different purposes and guidelines:

- **`workshop/`** — Hands-on training modules with personas, exercises, and metrics (15+ years experience → newcomers)
- **`tech-talks/`** — Technical deep-dives for practitioners (30-60 min presentations on specific capabilities)
- **`exec-talks/`** — Executive thought leadership (strategic context for leadership decision-making)

---

## Content-Type Specific Guidelines

### Workshop Content (`workshop/` directory)

**Purpose:** Hands-on training with progressive skill-building through personas and exercises

**Key characteristics:**

- Persona-driven narratives (Sarah, Marcus, David, Elena, Rafael)
- Outcome-based language (what was built/validated, not "learned")
- Quantifiable metrics in Before/After comparisons
- Hands-on exercises with concrete artifacts

**For content creation:** Use `module-planner` or `module-creator` agents (detailed requirements in `.github/agents/`)

**Persona reference:** [workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md](../workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md)

### Tech Talk Content (`tech-talks/` directory)

**Purpose:** Technical deep-dives for practitioners exploring specific capabilities or patterns

**Key characteristics:**

- Clear problem statement and motivation
- Technical depth with practical examples
- Architectural diagrams and system flows
- Implementation guidance and tradeoffs
- Concrete takeaways for immediate application

**Tone:** Expert-to-expert, assumes technical background, focuses on "how" and "why"

### Executive Talk Content (`exec-talks/` directory)

**Purpose:** Thought leadership for technical leaders making strategic decisions about AI adoption

**Key characteristics:**

- Strategic framing with business context
- Industry parallels and analogies (aviation, manufacturing, etc.)
- Organizational implications and transformation patterns
- Risk mitigation and governance frameworks
- C-level/VP-level decision criteria

**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible, focuses on "what this means" for the organization

## Tone and Voice

- **Respectful** — Treat all experience levels with dignity
- **Practical** — Focus on what works, not theory for theory's sake
- **Honest** — Acknowledge limitations and tradeoffs
- **Encouraging** — Celebrate progress, normalize learning curves

---

## Slide Generation Guidelines

When creating Slidev presentations, follow these principles:

- **Maximum 15-20 slides per module** — Force focused, essential content only
- **Extract content from source README** — Preserve persona quotes, metrics, and exercise objectives
- **Visual hierarchy** — Use emoji vocabulary consistently (🎯, ⏰, 📊, etc.)
- **Beautiful, polished design** — Dark cockpit-style with Tailwind CSS, never use Mermaid diagrams

**For detailed visual design guidelines:** Use the `slide-generator` agent (see `.github/agents/slide-generator.agent.md`)

**Persona reference:** [workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md](../workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md)

## Quick Voice Checklist

Before submitting content, verify:

- [ ] **Outcomes not learning** — Shows what was built/validated, not what was discovered
- [ ] **Metrics included** — At least 2-3 quantified improvements in Before/After
- [ ] **Evidence-based** — Demonstrates through action, not claims understanding
- [ ] **Persona-authentic** — Uses the persona's unique lens (Sarah=ROI, David=expertise, etc.)
- [ ] **Professional tone** — Treats all as experienced professionals validating tools
