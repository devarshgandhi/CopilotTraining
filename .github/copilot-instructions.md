# Copilot Instructions for CopilotTraining Content Development

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three types of content, each with different purposes and guidelines:

- **`workshop/`** — Hands-on training modules with personas, exercises, and metrics (15+ years experience → newcomers)
- **`tech-talks/`** — Technical deep-dives for practitioners (30-60 min presentations on specific capabilities)
- **`exec-talks/`** — Executive thought leadership (strategic context for leadership decision-making)

---

## Content-Type Specific Guidelines

### Workshop Content (`workshop/` directory)

**Purpose:** Hands-on training with progressive skill-building through personas and exercises

**Key characteristics:**

- Persona-driven narratives (Sarah, Marcus, David, Elena, Rafael)
- Outcome-based language (what was built/validated, not "learned")
- Quantifiable metrics in Before/After comparisons
- Hands-on exercises with concrete artifacts

**For content creation:** Use `module-planner` or `module-creator` agents (detailed requirements in `.github/agents/`)

**Persona reference:** [workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md](../workshop/00-orientation/PERSONAS.md)

### Tech Talk Content (`tech-talks/` directory)

**Purpose:** Technical deep-dives for practitioners exploring specific capabilities or patterns

**Key characteristics:**

- Clear problem statement and motivation
- Technical depth with practical examples
- Architectural diagrams and system flows
- Implementation guidance and tradeoffs
- Concrete takeaways for immediate application
- Required working artifacts (configs, workflows, code samples)

**For content creation:** Use `Tech Talk Generator` agent (detailed requirements in `.github/agents/tech-talk-generator.agent.md`)

**Template reference:** [tech-talks/TEMPLATE.md](../tech-talks/TEMPLATE.md)

**Tone:** Expert-to-expert, assumes technical background, focuses on "how" and "why"

### Executive Talk Content (`exec-talks/` directory)

**Purpose:** Thought leadership for technical leaders making strategic decisions about AI adoption

**Key characteristics:**

- Strategic framing with business context
- Industry parallels and analogies (aviation, manufacturing, etc.)
- Organizational implications and transformation patterns
- Risk mitigation and governance frameworks
- C-level/VP-level decision criteria

**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible, focuses on "what this means" for the organization

## Tone and Voice

- **Respectful** — Treat all experience levels with dignity
- **Practical** — Focus on what works, not theory for theory's sake
- **Honest** — Acknowledge limitations and tradeoffs
- **Encouraging** — Celebrate progress, normalize learning curves

---

## Slide Generation Guidelines

When creating Slidev presentations, follow these principles:

- **Maximum 15-20 slides per module** — Force focused, essential content only
- **Extract content from source README** — Preserve persona quotes, metrics, and exercise objectives
- **Visual hierarchy** — Use emoji vocabulary consistently (🎯, ⏰, 📊, etc.)
- **Beautiful, polished design** — Dark cockpit-style with Tailwind CSS, never use Mermaid diagrams

### Slide Frontmatter Requirements

All slide files **must** include these fields in the YAML frontmatter:

- `status: active` or `status: archived` — Indicates whether the deck is live or frozen
- `updated: YYYY-MM-DD` — Date of last modification

**Archived slides (`status: archived`) must never be modified, regenerated, or fixed by any agent or skill.** If an agent encounters an archived slide, it must stop and inform the user. The build scripts (`build-all.sh`, `build-all.ps1`) automatically skip archived slides — their last-built output remains deployed until manually removed.

### Tech Talk / Exec Talk Frontmatter Requirements

All tech talk and exec talk README.md files **must** include YAML frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
status: active # or "archived"
updated: 2026-02-08 # last modification date
section: "Context & Customization" # index-custom.html sub-group
---
```

**Fields:**

- `status` — `active` or `archived`. Archived talks must never be modified by agents.
- `updated` — Date of last modification (YYYY-MM-DD). Agents must update this when modifying content.
- `section` — The sub-group in `slides/index-custom.html` where the slide card belongs. Valid values:
  - `Copilot Surfaces` — Chat, CLI, Web, Memory, Terminal Sandboxing
  - `Context & Customization` — Instructions, Hooks, SDK, MCP, Primitives
  - `Agent Architecture` — Teams, Multi-Step Tasks, Parallel Execution
  - `Agentic Transformation` — Journey, SDLC, Enterprise Patterns
  - `Executive Talks` — Used for exec-talks only
- `references` — _(optional)_ Array of authoritative URLs used as sources for the talk's content. Each entry has:
  - `url` — _(required)_ Full URL to the official documentation or source
  - `label` — _(required)_ Short human-readable description of the page
  - `verified` — _(required)_ Date (YYYY-MM-DD) when the URL was last confirmed accurate and accessible

  Example:

  ```yaml
  references:
    - url: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/...
      label: "Official overview page"
      verified: 2026-02-17
  ```

  Agents should populate `references` from the talk's `research.md` URLs when creating or updating content. The `scripts/check-references.mjs` script validates that all reference URLs are still accessible.

**Change detection:** When generating slides, compare the README's `updated` date against the slide file's `updated` date. If the README is newer, the slide needs regeneration. If the slide is newer or equal, it's already up to date.

### Slide Index "NEW" Badge

`slides/index-custom.html` displays a **NEW** badge on cards for slides updated within the last 7 days. This is driven by a `SLIDE_DATES` JavaScript map inside the HTML file, which maps topic slugs to their `updated:` dates from frontmatter.

**After any slide is created, modified, or has its `updated:` date changed**, agents must run the sync script to keep the badge data current:

```bash
node slides/scripts/sync-index-dates.mjs
```

Use `--check` to verify without modifying (useful in CI). The script reads `updated:` from all slide frontmatter and rewrites the `SLIDE_DATES` map in `index-custom.html`.

**For slide generation:** Use the `slide-generator` agent (see `.github/agents/slide-generator.agent.md`)

### Recommended Workflow

```
Use slide-generator agent to create slides for workshop/03-custom-prompts
```

This generates slides from the module README (selective, 15-20 slides), updates the slide index, and reports completion.

## Quick Voice Checklist

Before submitting content, verify:

- [ ] **Outcomes not learning** — Shows what was built/validated, not what was discovered
- [ ] **Metrics included** — At least 2-3 quantified improvements in Before/After
- [ ] **Evidence-based** — Demonstrates through action, not claims understanding
- [ ] **Persona-authentic** — Uses the persona's unique lens (Sarah=ROI, David=expertise, etc.)
- [ ] **Professional tone** — Treats all as experienced professionals validating tools

---

## Agent Invocation Guidelines

When calling subagents (via `runSubagent`), keep prompts minimal:

- **Trust agent configuration** — Agents already have access to this file and their own `.agent.md` instructions
- **Don't repeat rules** — Never re-state guidelines from copilot-instructions.md or agent definitions
- **Be concise** — Just specify the target (e.g., "Generate slides for workshop/03-custom-prompts")
- **Let agents work** — They're configured to follow workspace conventions automatically

**Bad example:**

> "Generate slides following the slide generation guidelines, using emoji vocabulary, dark cockpit-style, max 15-20 slides..."

**Good example:**

> "Generate slides for workshop/03-custom-prompts"
