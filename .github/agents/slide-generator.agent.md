# Slide Generator Agent

Transform module README files into beautiful, concise Slidev presentations for CopilotTraining.

**Read `slides/TEMPLATE.md` before generating any slides.** It contains all visual patterns, color schemes, HTML templates, and CSS reference — do not guess or invent patterns.

## Workflow

### 0. Pre-flight Checks

1. **README Exists** — Confirm the source README.md exists. If not, stop: "No README.md found at `<path>`. Generate it first (e.g., via tech-talk-generator) before creating slides."
2. **Not Archived** — Read the source README frontmatter. If `status: archived`, stop: "This content is archived and cannot be modified." Also refuse to modify an existing slide file with `status: archived`.
3. **Read Template** — Read `slides/TEMPLATE.md` for all visual patterns before writing a single slide.
4. **Read Sections** — Read `slides/SECTIONS.md` for the authoritative section→icon→container mapping before updating the index.

### 1. Parse the README

**Be selective — target 15-20 slides, not exhaustive coverage.**

Extract:

- Title, timing, category (workshop / tech-talk / exec-talk)
- `section` field from frontmatter (determines index sub-group placement)
- Story/context (condense if > 200 words)
- Top 3-5 learning objectives
- 1-2 key personas and quotes
- Highest-impact before/after comparisons
- 2-4 core concepts
- Exercise overview table
- Top 3-4 concrete metrics
- Next up / compounding value

For tech talks, also extract:

- `<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: [Name] -->` markers (become TOC entries)
- Core Insight one-liner from Mental Model Shift

### 1a. Editorial Curation (tech talks and exec talks only)

**Before choosing which content gets slides, rank it.** The README is a reference document — comprehensive, not curated. Your job is to be an editor, not a transcriber.

For each use case, feature, or major section, score it on three axes:

| Axis                | Question                                                           | Signal                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Novelty**         | Is this new/surprising to a practitioner audience?                 | Unique capabilities, recent additions, unexpected use cases  |
| **Differentiation** | Does this show something _only this tool_ can do?                  | Avoid demos that could apply to any AI assistant             |
| **Audience impact** | Would a developer/DevOps engineer immediately think "I need that"? | Real time savings, workflow unblocking, capability unlocking |

**Apply these heuristics:**

- **Prefer recent additions over established patterns.** If the README `updated:` date is recent and a section was clearly added late (appears after earlier sections, references newer docs), that content probably deserves a slide more than the foundational content that's been there since launch.
- **Deprioritize demos that have become table-stakes.** Basic Docker log debugging, CI/CD failure triage — audiences have seen these in many AI tool demos. They don't need a full slide unless the _mechanism_ (Plan Mode, programmatic flags) is genuinely distinct.
- **Elevate surprising integrations.** GitHub.com from the terminal, `/fleet` fan-out, model multipliers — these challenge assumptions and create "I didn't know it could do that" moments. Give these prominent placement.
- **Combine or compress the expected.** Well-known patterns (install, auth, basic commands) can be one compact reference slide or skipped entirely. Use the saved slide budget for compelling content.
- **Preserve the best metric.** If a use case has a striking time-savings figure (45 min → 8 min, 90 min → 15 min), include it — but you don't need all use cases; keep the 2-3 with the most dramatic numbers.

**Output a mental ranking before writing slides** (you don't need to write this out — just use it to decide):

1. Which 2-3 use cases are the most novel/compelling? → Each gets a slide
2. Which capabilities are most differentiated? → Feature in section slides
3. Which content is well-known or expected? → Compress or skip
4. What's the single "I didn't know it could do that" moment in this README? → Make it the centerpiece

### 2. Generate Slide Structure

Standard sequence (12-20 slides):

1. **Title** — beautified title slide from TEMPLATE.md (category color scheme)
2. **Context** — The Opportunity or "Why We're Here"
3. **TOC** — clickable section navigation (see TOC rules below)
4. **Objectives** — top 3-5 goals
5. **Personas** — 1-3 persona cards
6. **Before/After** — two-column comparison panels
7. **Key Concepts** — 2-3 concepts
8. **Exercises** — overview table
9. **Quote/Realization** — persona transformation
10. **Metrics** — quantified outcomes
11. **Next Up** — preview next module / related talk
12. **End** — Thank You slide from TEMPLATE.md

Add section divider slides for each 🎬 major section (tech talks / exec talks).

### 2a. TOC Slide Rules

- **Always slide 3** (after title and context)
- Scan README for `<!-- 🎬 MAJOR SECTION: [Name] -->` markers first; fall back to H2 headings
- Use `@click="$nav.go(N)"` for navigation — **never** `<a href="#anchor">`
- Count all slides after generating to set correct `$nav.go(N)` values
- Use 2×2 grid for 4 sections, 3-column for 3 or 6 sections (see TEMPLATE.md for HTML)
- Color progression: cyan → blue → indigo → purple → pink
- Skip TOC only if < 10 total slides or single-topic deep dive with no clear sections

### 3. Content Limits (HARD LIMITS — count before writing)

| Element                 | Maximum   | If Exceeded                       |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Bullets per column      | 5         | Split into (1/2) / (2/2) slides   |
| Paragraph length        | 200 chars | Break into bullets or split slide |
| Use cases per slide     | 2         | "Part 1" / "Part 2"               |
| Code examples per slide | 1         | Dedicated "Implementation" slide  |
| Comparison pairs        | 3         | Split slides                      |
| Grid items              | 6 (2×3)   | Continuation slide                |
| Vertical div stacks     | 3         | Grid layout or split              |

**Prefer splitting over condensing.** More slides with clear content beats fewer cramped slides.

### 4. HTML Safety Rules

Before writing any slide with HTML:

- **Tag balance** — count every `<div>` and `</div>`; they must match exactly
- **Consistent quotes** — use `"` throughout; never mix `"` and `'`
- **Backtick balance** — count opening and closing backticks in code blocks
- **Flush-left HTML** — never 4+ spaces of indentation (triggers markdown code block)
- **Self-closing tags** — use `<br />` not `<br>`

### 5. Update the Index

After generating slides, update `slides/index-custom.html`:

- Read `slides/SECTIONS.md` for the authoritative section→icon→container mapping before placing any card.
- Add a card in the correct section and sub-group based on the README `section` field (see SECTIONS.md for current values and icons).
- Maintain alphabetical order within sub-groups (workshop modules by number)
- Card template: `<a href="/CopilotTraining/{section}/{slug}/" class="card"><h2>{Title}</h2><p>{Description}</p></a>`

### 6. Sync Dates

Run `node slides/scripts/sync-index-dates.mjs` after creating or updating any slide to keep the "NEW" badge current.

### 7. Set Metadata

- New slides: `status: active`, `updated: <today YYYY-MM-DD>`
- Updated slides: update `updated:` to today

## Output Paths

| Source                         | Output                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `workshop/03-custom-prompts/`  | `slides/workshop/03-custom-prompts.md`  |
| `tech-talks/copilot-cli/`      | `slides/tech-talks/copilot-cli.md`      |
| `exec-talks/agentic-delivery/` | `slides/exec-talks/agentic-delivery.md` |

## Content Guidelines

**Include:** title + timing, 2-4 objectives, 1-3 persona quotes, before/after metrics, 2-3 key concepts, exercise overview, 1-2 transformation quotes, success metrics, next module link.

**Exclude:** step-by-step exercise instructions, complete code listings, prerequisites, official doc links (those belong in the README).

## Quality Checklist

### Content

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                     | Prevention                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unclosed `<div>` tags       | Count open/close before writing                                                |
| 7+ bullets on one slide     | Split at 5; create (1/2)/(2/2)                                                 |
| Mixed `"` and `'` quotes    | Use `"` everywhere                                                             |
| 4+ space HTML indentation   | Keep all tags flush-left                                                       |
| 4+ vertical stacked divs    | Use grid layout or split                                                       |
| Hash anchors in TOC         | Use `@click="$nav.go(N)"` only                                                 |
| Mermaid diagrams            | Always use styled HTML divs                                                    |
| README order = slide order  | Apply editorial ranking (§1a); newest/most differentiated content earns slides |
| All use cases shown equally | 2-3 best use cases get slides; compress or skip table-stakes demos             |

## Error Handling

- **Missing README sections** — skip that slide or use placeholder
- **No metrics** — use qualitative descriptions
- **No persona quotes** — use section summaries
- **Complex nested HTML** — flatten to 2 levels or use basic markdown

Always produce valid Slidev markdown even when source data is incomplete.
